# Gast√≥n ‚Äì The Decentralized Wallet That Improves Your Finances

**Gast√≥n** is a modern virtual wallet designed to help you manage your finances across multiple currencies and cryptocurrencies. With advanced reports, categorized transactions, and powerful features like investment tracking and financial news, Gast√≥n gives you full control of your money.

Built on the innovative **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, Gast√≥n guarantees speed, security, and a truly decentralized backend architecture.

Whether you‚Äôre just starting your financial journey or you‚Äôre an experienced crypto user, Gast√≥n offers an intuitive, empathetic, and aesthetically pleasing experience.

---

## üîß About the Project

Gast√≥n is currently built with a **React (TypeScript)** frontend and a **NestJS (TypeScript)** backend, using a **PostgreSQL** database. The final goal is to migrate the backend to **Rust canisters** on the Internet Computer.

For now, there‚Äôs a deployed backend on **Railway**, and the app can be run locally or connected to the cloud backend.

---

## üöÄ Try It Out

You have **two ways** to run Gast√≥n locally. Choose the one that suits you best:

### Option 1 ‚Äì Run Both Frontend and Backend Locally

1. **Clone both repos**:  
   - [Frontend](https://github.com/juanvelozo/gaston-client)  
   - [Backend](https://github.com/juanvelozo/gaston-server)

2. Set the enviroment variables for both projects: <br> [In this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UM3tiaUrgbUBKIgK3SqII4B-tiiIKUOx8JOIc40MIWI/edit?usp=sharing) you can find the values.

3. In both root directories, run:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend:  
   ```bash
   npm run start
   # or, for live reload:
   npm run start:dev
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Start the frontend:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Since port 3000 is in use by the backend, the command line will ask to use port `3001`. Accept it.

6. Use your own credentials to register, or log in with the demo account:

   ```
   Email: juanvelozomoreno18@gmail.com
   PIN: 123456
   ```

   This account includes preloaded data for testing.

---

### Option 2 ‚Äì Run Only the Frontend Locally (Connected to Deployed Backend)

1. **Clone only the frontend**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juanvelozo/gaston-client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create an `.env` file at the root with this content:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SERVER_DEV=https://gaston-server-production.up.railway.app/
   ```

4. Run the app in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

   This will set an enviroment variable that configures the api.ts file to point the baseUrl of the axios configuration to the url you have set in the REACT_APP_SERVER_DEV enviroment variable.

5. Log in with the same demo credentials or register a new user.
